# My first i3 Ubuntu Rice
### Please note this is only tested on Ubuntu 18.04
Heavily inspired by [this](https://github.com/victoriadotdev/i3-linux-config-tokyo-rice/tree/master/i3-tokyo-skyline-theme)

In order to install i3 gaps on ubuntu you can run this:

    # bash i3-setup.sh

This will install

 - Git (So you can download the i3-gaps repo)
 - i3-gaps
 - i3status - (Cool status bar)
 - i3lock - (So you can lock the screen)
 - suckless-tools - (So i3status works)
 - cava - Audio Visualizer
 - tizonia - Music Player (Spotify, Soundcloud etc)
 
 Then you can restart and select i3 from the Ubuntu login screen.
 
 Then just copy the i3 files into the correct places (e.g i3.conf would become .config/i3/config)
